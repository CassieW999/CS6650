**Brief Introduction**:

This assignment includes a Java server[MusicAlbums], a Go server[go-server-server-generated], a general java client[client] that calls on the autogenerated swaggerhub api package[java-client-generated] for RESTfull requests on both servers.

The load test class in Java client is called `LoadTestClient.java`

To run load tests on both servers, you will need this pattern

```
java LoadTestClient <threadGroupSize> <numThreadGroups> <delay> <IPAddr>
```
